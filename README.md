 # 📱 Mobile-Friendly Portfolio Website

This project is part of a Web Development Internship task to convert a static desktop-only website into a **responsive and mobile-friendly** layout using **CSS media queries**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** with Media Queries
- **Responsive Web Design Principles**
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## 🎯 What I Did
- Created a clean developer portfolio using HTML and CSS.
- Applied media queries to adapt the layout for mobile screens (max-width: 768px).
- Ensured all elements (text, nav, images, cards) are responsive.
- Used the `viewport` meta tag for proper scaling on mobile devices.
- Tested responsiveness using Chrome DevTools and GitHub Pages preview.
